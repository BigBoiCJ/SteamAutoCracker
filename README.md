## GUI Edition
This branch contains the Graphical User Interface version of Steam Auto Cracker.\
It is coded a bit differently, and will probably replace the console version soon.

It should be relatively easy to use compared to the original version.

Currently released as "Pre-release" because a lot of code changes, and it's basically a whole new program.\
If it works great and I get good feedback, it will become a full stable release and will replace the old console-based version.\
In that case, this branch will disappear and the GUI version will go in the `main` branch.
